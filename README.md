Brief:
The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) (Zitzler and Thiele 1999)
is a relatively recent technique for finding or approximating the Pareto-optimal set
for multiobjective optimization problems. In different studies (Zitzler and Thiele
1999; Zitzler, Deb, and Thiele 2000) SPEA has shown very good performance in
comparison to other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and therefore it has
been a point of reference in various recent investigations, e.g., (Corne, Knowles,
and Oates 2000). Furthermore, it has been used in different applications, e.g., (Lahanas,
Milickovic, Baltas, and Zamboglou 2001). In this paper, an improved version,
namely SPEA2, is proposed, which incorporates in contrast to its predecessor
a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an
enhanced archive truncation method. The comparison of SPEA2 with SPEA and
two other modern elitist methods, PESA and NSGA-II, on different test problems
yields promising results.
